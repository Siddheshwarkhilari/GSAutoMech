1] Remove the Map Integration section from the contact section
2] Decrease the size of hero-section for 'About us', 'Products', 'Gallery', 'Contact' i.e the section present at top of each page and make it smaller and effective in size

   I will follow a directory structure where i will keep all the photos and video here regarding the topic i mentioned here 
   so that i can customize the whole website according to me, i can replace the photos and videos with those places here.
   Also you can mention dummy names and path from the public folder,so i will later after modification will replace them with correct names and 
   render my photos

   with name as logo.png
7] For the contact us section, after filling all the details, the mail should be send to correct mail id that i will place here, for now consider
   mail id as "siddheshkhilari111@gmail.com", This functionality should work properly
